The subject (male, 39 y.o., 1.80 m, 82 kg, spinal cord injury at T5 level) performed one cycle of manual wheelchair propulsion on level ground at comfortable speed.
He signed an inform consent and the experimental procedures were approved by the local ethic’s committee.

Trajectories of skin markers were recorded with a 12-cameras Motion Analysis System (Santa Rosa, CA, USA) at 100 Hz (filtered using a 4th-order Butterworth with a cut-off frequency of 5 Hz).
Propulsion kinetics were recorded using an instrumented wheel (TSR, Merignac, France) at 500 Hz (filtered using a 2nd-order Butterworth with a cut-off frequency of 20 Hz and resampled at 100 Hz).
