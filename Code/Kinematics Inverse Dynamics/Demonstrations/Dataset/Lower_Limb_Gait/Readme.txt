The subject (male, 50 y.o., 1.85 m, 90 kg, asymptomatic) performed one gait cycle on level ground at comfortable speed.
He signed an inform consent and the experimental procedures were approved by the local ethic’s committee.

Trajectories of skin markers were recorded with a 12-cameras Motion Analysis System (Santa Rosa, CA, USA) at 100 Hz (filtered using a 4th-order Butterworth with a cut-off frequency of 6 Hz).
Ground reaction forces were recorded using an AMTI forceplate (Watertown, MA, USA) at 100 Hz (filtered using a 2nd-order Butterworth with a cut-off frequency of 20 Hz).
